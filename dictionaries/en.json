If no employment contract is concluded between the company and the applicant, the application documents will be deleted six months after notification of the rejection decision, provided that deletion does not conflict with any other legitimate interests or contractual obligations. In addition, the    <a href=\"https://www.digitalent.ch/datenschutz\">data protection provisions</a>    of the service provider apply. </p>"
